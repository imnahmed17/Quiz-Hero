            <span class="bg-orange-200 px-2 rounded">Question 1:</span> What are the 
            differences between map, filter, forEach and find? 
          </li>
          <li class="my-1.5 text-justify">
            <span class="bg-slate-200 px-2 rounded">map()</span> is used to create 
            a new array from an existing array. It iterates through each element in the 
            array and applies the provided function to each element and returns a new 
            array. It doesn't alter the original array.
          </li>
          <li class="my-1.5 text-justify">
            <span class="bg-slate-200 px-2 rounded">filter()</span> is used to create 
            a new array from an existing array by filtering out unwanted elements. It 
            iterates through each element of the array and returns a new array with only 
            the elements that pass the filter criteria.
          </li>
          <li class="my-1.5 text-justify">
            <span class="bg-slate-200 px-2 rounded">forEach()</span> is used to iterate 
            through an array and perform an action on each element. It does not return a 
            new array, but instead applies a function to each element of the existing array.
          </li>
          <li class="my-1.5 text-justify">
            <span class="bg-slate-200 px-2 rounded">find()</span> is used to find a 
            single element in an array that matches a given criteria. It iterates through 
            each element of the array and returns the first element that matches the given 
            criteria.

          <li class="my-4">
            <span class="bg-orange-200 px-2 rounded">Question 2:</span> What are the 
            differences between local storage, session storage and cookies?
          </li>
          <li class="my-1.5 text-justify">
            <span class="bg-slate-200 px-2 rounded">Local storage</span> allows web 
            applications to store data locally within the user's browser. It is permanent 
            and remains even when the browser is closed. It can store up to 10MB of data.
          </li>
          <li class="my-1.5 text-justify">
            <span class="bg-slate-200 px-2 rounded">Session storage</span> is similar 
            to local storage, but it is limited to the current session. It is deleted when 
            the user closes the browser. It can store up to 5MB of data.
          </li>
          <li class="my-1.5 text-justify">
            <span class="bg-slate-200 px-2 rounded">Cookies</span> are small pieces of 
            data stored in the user's browser. They are usually used to store information 
            like login credentials, preferences, and shopping cart items. They are usually 
            limited to 4KB of data and can be deleted by the user at any time.

          <li class="my-4">
            <span class="bg-orange-200 px-2 rounded">Question 3:</span> What is event 
            loop and how does it work?
          </li>
          <li class="my-1.5 text-justify">
            <span class="bg-slate-200 px-2 rounded">Event Loop</span> is the secret 
            behind JavaScript's asynchronous programming. It has one simple job to monitor 
            the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event 
            Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call 
            Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the 
            Event Loop. Each event is just a function callback. It works by repeatedly 
            checking for new events or inputs, and then processing them in order. The 
            Event Loop is responsible for responding to user input, refreshing the display, 
            and handling communication with other systems.

            <span class="bg-orange-200 px-2 rounded">Question 4:</span> What is use of 
            "quizTimer()" function in this project? 
          </li>
          <li class="my-1.5 text-justify">
            The <span class="bg-slate-200 px-2 rounded">quizTimer()</span> function is 
            used to keep track of the time a user takes to answer the quizzes. The function 
            also takes a dismiss argument, if it is set to true, will stop the counting. 
            Initially, the color of the timer is green but when the value of the timer 
            exceeds 60 seconds the color of the timer turns red.

            "chooseQuiz()" function in this project? 
          </li>
          <li class="my-1.5 text-justify">
            The <span class="bg-slate-200 px-2 rounded">chooseQuiz()</span> function 
            takes an index and a given answer as arguments and updates the answers array 
            for the selected quiz from the quizData array. It checks whether the quizzes 
            answer already exists in the answers array and if it does, it replaces the 
            existing answer with the given answer. If not, it adds the quizzes answer to 
            the answers array. It also calls the displayAnswers function to display the 
            updated answers array.
